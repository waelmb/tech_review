Vertigo crisis

Background: Meniere’s disease is often characterized by a changing horizontal nystagmus during the crisis;
however, vertical nystagmus is not often detected. The horizontal nystagmus is frequently studied in the irritative
or destructive phases of the disease.
Clinical findings: We report the case of a 70 years-old man suffering for 3 years of Meniere’s disease in his right
ear. During an attack we found an infrequent nystagmus that was a downbeat nystagmus in primary position. He
was then closely followed in the ward during 5 days and daily tests were performed. We first ruled out a central
cause and were able to explain that as due to a peripheral deficit in the right posterior semicircular canal. Other
features of the vertigo attacks in patients with MD were recorded.
Summary: We studied a patient presenting a vertigo attack with a downbeat nystagmus. Our findings show that
this nystagmus was caused by his own Meniere’s disease, specifically by a posterior canal hypofunction, and not
by a central disorder. There is no evidence about this kind of nystagmus in Meniere disease and, to the best to our
knowledge, this is one of the first reports its evaluation using the test nowadays available.
Conclusion: In this case, our result demonstrate that the downbeat nystagmus was caused by a hypofunction of
the posterior semicircular canal.

1. Introduction

acetazolamide (250mg once a day) with periodic analytical control. This
treatment established good control as demonstrated in different followups and we remove it in December 2020 (see Fig. 1).
The day seen at emergency he was very dizzy and when moving
severe nausea and vomiting occurred. He noticed a more intense tinnitus
and pressure in his right ear. He showed normal cognition and alertness
without slurred or scanning speech and exam was considered normal
unless a doubtful and subtle decomposition of movement in the right
heel–knee–shin test was observed, however, a true dysmetria in the
limbs or truncal ataxia were not appreciated. The gait of the patient was
unsteady and tended to veer to the right side, but it was not wide-base.
There was an intense downbeat nystagmus on primary gaze that
increased in intensity in leftward gaze but decreased in rightward gaze,
becoming only apparent a horizontal left beating nystagmus (video 1).
When visual fixation was removed the same but more intense nystagmus
was found. On vHIT (Fig. 3) we found a reduced gain for stimulation in
the planes of the right horizontal and posterior semicircular canals: in

In patients with clinically active Meniere’s disease (MD) the results
of the vestibular examination are in part dependent on the lapse of time
since the last vertigo crisis or attack [1] and, during the crisis, this will
change to an orderly manner [2]. Here, we report the case of a patient
diagnosed with definite MD that suffered an activation displaying some
confusing signs at initial exam. (see Table 1)
1.1. Clinical case
In February 2021, we assisted a 70-year-old man suffering from an
intense vertigo crisis, which had started that same day. In 2009 he
suffered a heart attack which required the installation of a stent. In
2016, he suffered an acute pancreatitis and was further diagnosed of
hypercholesterolemia and diabetes type 2. He was diagnosed in 2017 of
Meniere’s disease in his right ear and begun treatment with

Fig. 1. MRI for hidrops detection in 2018. A, axial inversion recovery with REAL reconstruction at a midmodiolar level. The MRI study is obtained 4 hours after a
single dose of intravenous contrast is administrated. The image shows severe endolymphatic hidrops (black signal) both vestibular and cochlear. All vestibular cavity
is occupied with endolymph, even with some degree of herniation to the non-ampullar segment of the horizontal semicircular canal (White arrow). Also, endolymph
encompasses half or more of the scala vestibuli, with displacement of the Reissner’s membrane (arrowhead). B, 3D volume-rendered image of the inner ear with

both, saccades were covert and overt, and in the later with the fast phase
of the downbeat nystagmus as seen also in the recordings of the left
superior semicircular canal. During testing the patient became
extremely dizzy so we had to stop exam. An MRI was ordered at the
moment of the crisis (Fig. 2a and b) that showed no changes to that done
in 2018 and also a CT angiogram (Fig. 2c and d). We decided not to treat
the patient but only medication in case of vomiting was recommended as
PRN.

The next day (day 2) the patient was not symptomatic. The following
day (day 3) he started to feel again vertigo and tinnitus worsened: an
intense third degree right beating spontaneous nystagmus was recorded,
its slow phase velocity (SPV) was 42◦ s− 1. This nystagmus was more
intense for rightward gaze and similar for leftward gaze, and direction
did not change neither for upward nor for downward gaze; vHIT is
shown in Fig. 3. The fourth day the patient felt better but still dizzy: the
nystagmus was a 2nd degree left-beating and vHIT (Fig. 3) changed from
previous. He was treated with intratympanic dexamethasone (23mg/ml
in one dose). Because of a good follow-up, the patient was discharged in
good status the sixth day.

2. Discussion
When the patient visited the emergency room, we first considered a
patient with a low activity MD in his right ear for the last 2 years who
was facing an increase in this activity for the last 2 weeks. However
coincident with his vascular risk factors now the most striking finding at
the emergency room was the downbeat nystagmus which usually points
to a lesion in the flocculus. A floccular (or parafloccular) lesion could
result in loss of inhibition of the superior vestibular nucleus neurons and
consequently in a relative hyperexcitation of the superior rectus moto­
neurons in the third nucleus: this elicits and upward slow eye deviation
[3]. In the evaluation of the observed spontaneous nystagmus our pur­
pose was first to detect whether this occurred in eye- or head-fixed co­
ordinates which is a quick bedside indication of a central or peripheral
dysfunction respectively [4]. For that, nystagmus has to be examined
when the patient looks in a direction orthogonal to that of the
nystagmus: in our case when looking right and left and considering that
the further the eye is moved, the greater the eye-referenced and
head-referenced characteristics of the nystagmus will be seen [5]. In our
patient we could rule out with some degree of certainty a central from
peripheral origin as nystagmus was almost pure left-beating in right­
ward gaze and additionally, because of the effect of visual fixation that

reduced in part its intensity as well the absence of gaze-evoked
nystagmus, and ocular tilt reaction [6].
The previous assumption was further supported by the findings
during the vHIT testing that pointed to an acute right labyrinth deficit at
least in the horizontal and posterior semicircular canals. Taking that into
consideration nystagmus could be explained as a mixed loss of excit­
atory projections to the right superior oblique and medial rectus and to
the left inferior and lateral rectus muscles. The right superior oblique
losses its main action (intorsion) as well secondary (depression and
abduction) so that the eyes slowly drift upward (facilitated by left
inferior inhibition) and rightward (facilitated by the right medial and
left lateral inhibition). The optimal gaze position to test for the right
superior oblique and left inferior is the primary and leftward gaze so that
we observe the most downbeat nystagmus. In the rightward gaze posi­
tion their action is less relevant so that mainly the horizontal disfacilitation will be best appreciated as leftward nystagmus.
Given these findings, those at neurological examination and MRI, the
follow-up has confirmed a peripheral vestibulopathy in the context of
his disease as the cause of this patient’s crisis.

3. Conclusion
In this case, we report a patient with MD which, in an acute crisis,
had a downbeat nystagmus. This case in one of the first which report it.
Furthermore, we contribute with a physiopathology theory for this
downbeat nystagmus. The extreme variability in results in different re­
ports stresses the importance of serial evaluation not only since the
initiation of the attack but also days after.
