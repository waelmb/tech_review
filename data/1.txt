Abstract Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late December 2019,
it has brought significant harm and challenges to over 200 countries and regions around the
world. However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others. There are
difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national
prevention and control of this epidemic. This article reviews the characteristics, treatment,
and outcomes of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19, hoping it would be helpful for early
prevention and control of this severe public health threat worldwide.

Introduction
At the end of December 2019, the novel coronavirus
pneumonia began to spread in Wuhan, China. The World
Health Organization (WHO) officially named this disease
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 11, 2020.
At the same time, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced that the new coronavirus
was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the outbreak, COVID-19 has brought
major harm and challenges to more than 200 countries and
regions around the world. To date, more than 3,000,000
cases have been confirmed worldwide and the cumulative
deaths have exceeded 200,000.1,2
COVID-19 initially has been divided into four types: mild,
moderate, severe, and critical cases.3 However, with the
global outbreak of coronavirus, there is increasing evidence
that many infections of COVID-19 are asymptomatic, but
they can transmit the virus to others. Asymptomatic
infections refer to the positive detection of nucleic acid of
SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but have no typical
clinical symptoms or signs, and no apparent abnormalities
in images, including lung computed tomography (CT).4 The

A systematic review of asymptomatic infections
clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections and
other types of COVID-19 are shown in Table 1. Early
recognition of an infected person and cutting off the route
of transmission are key points to control COVID-19. However, most asymptomatic infections do not seek medical
assistance due to no obvious clinical signs and poor prevention awareness, which contribute to the rapid spread of
COVID-19. Therefore, it is a great challenge to prevent and
control this specific type of patient globally, which requires
more attention worldwide.

Infectivity
Asymptomatic infections have the same infectivity as
symptomatic infections.5 It has been reported that a 53year-old UK patient with an asymptomatic COVID-19
infection may cause 11 infections.6 A report pointed out
that one asymptomatic person who experienced 19 days
from contact with the source of infection to RT-PCR
confirmation may have infected 5 people.7 These asymptomatic cases may play a role in the transmission and
therefore pose a significant challenge to infection control.
Estimates of the incidence of asymptomatic infections
will clarify the epidemiological potential of COVID-19
transmission and understanding of the true universality of
the disease. There are many studies on the incidence of
asymptomatic infections (Table 2), but each study has its
limitations. First of all, due to insufficient awareness of
asymptomatic infections and limited detection capabilities
in the early stage of the outbreak, China’s 1.6% may be
underestimated.8 On the contrary, another study investigated 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan at the
end of January and found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 30.8%.9 Another example is the
“Diamond Princess” cruise ship, which was isolated in
Japanese waters in early February due to COVID-19

infection found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 51.7%.10 Some researchers suggested that the
above two studies overestimated the incidence, but in fact,
a person truly has a higher risk if he has close contact with
diagnosed or suspected infected persons in a relatively
confined space. Incidence of asymptomatic infections from
other studies had some shortcomings, such as those in
Korea11 and Washington,12 which showed inaccurate results
due to the small sample size. One case in Wuhan tracked
the prevalence of 1391 children under 15 years old who had
been in close contact with infected or suspected cases.13
The incidence of asymptomatic infections in the children
is lower than that of the whole population, we propose that
it is related to the special immune response and ACE2 level
in the children’s bodies.14 According to these studies, the
ability of asymptomatic infections to spread the virus is not
low, and these patients are likely to cause a new round of
outbreaks. Therefore, finding asymptomatic infections is
the key point for early prevention and control of COVID-19
worldwide.
The incubation period is the approximate time from the
first exposure to the virus until the clinical symptoms or
signs onset, and patients can also transmit the virus in this
period.15 Asymptomatic infections have no special incubation due to no clinical signs. However, a recent research
found that the viral load detected in asymptomatic populations were similar to that in symptomatic patients,
indicating that asymptomatic infections have the potential
for transmission, which may occur early in the course of
infection.16 Since the viral nucleic acid positivity refers to
that the virus load in samples reaches a certain limit, but
the infectivity mainly depends on whether the virus is in a
reproductive state.17 That is, sometimes, despite ongoing
high viral loads, no live virus can be isolated, which means
that viral nucleic acid positivity does not indicate infectivity.18 It is also proved by a clinical study in which the
recovered COVID-19 patients who had no obvious clinical

As of the data published in the literature, the proportion of asymptomatic infections in the population with positive nucleic acid test.

symptoms were detected to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by
hyper-sensitive viral nucleic acid re-examination methods,
but these patients had not caused new infections.19 Due to
the limited data from current studies, we think that it is
necessary for us to be highly vigilant to asymptomatic infections. Moreover, viral nucleic acid positivity has been
reported not to be always considered, and more clinical
studies are still needed to verify that. A previous study
found that the median period of asymptomatic patients
from viral nucleic acid positive to negative was 9.5 days,
the longest was up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic
cases.20 Then in another study found that the median
period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive
nucleic acid test was 19 days (8e24 days) and 21.5 days
(10e36 days), respectively.21 The median period from
diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was 7.5 days (2e20
days) with normal or atypical chest CT infections and 12.5
days (8e22 days) with typical CT findings.21 However, an
asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for 14 days
until now,22 more studies are still needed to assess the
infectivity duration of asymptomatic cases. And if necessary, more attention should be paid to some special infectious individuals who need longer segregation due to the
result of nucleic acid test.

Distribution
The most likely source of asymptomatic infections is close
contacts of patients who have been diagnosed or suspected, and family clusters have been presented before.
Also, colleagues, friends, and people who coincide with the
trajectories of diagnosed or suspected patients are all
regarded as high-risk populations.
Familial cluster has made the epidemic challenging to
prevent and control. Some family members do not have any
clinical manifestations, but the nucleic acid test result is
positive, and this has become a major difficulty in the
prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In one case report,
all three of the family members were diagnosed with
COVID-19, and only one family member had clinical symptoms.23 Another family cluster report showed that the first
patient was in good health without clinical manifestations,
including fever and cough, and denied having primary diseases. He went to the local hospital for treatment only
because of urticaria. The patient stated that he had lived in
the local area for a long time and had not been to the
epidemic area. However, the investigation of the disease
control experts found that the patient had close contact
with his relatives in Hubei Province one week before the
onset of symptoms. Finally, by investigating the family
members and close contacts of the patient, three

pulmonary CT scans were normal, but the nucleic acid test
results were positive.24 Family members of COVID-19 patients, even without any symptoms, should be closely
monitored and examined to rule out infection. These cases
also highlight the need for a close epidemiological investigation to prevent the omission of possible sources of
contamination.
Different individuals may have different clinical signs.
Studies have shown that asymptomatic infections are more
common in populations of young and middle-aged individuals with functional performance status without underlying diseases. It was reported that asymptomatic cases
were more common in middle-aged people in Shenzhen
(median age:49 years, 30.9% between 30 and 49 years)25
and a few younger people in Nanjing (median age:32.5
years).20 Above all, age and body condition may play an
important role in the severity of COVID-19, and this is
related to different immune responses and other potential
pathogenesis.

Pathogenesis
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 invades cells by using
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor.26
Because ACE2-mediated angiotensin II (Ang ll) degradation
plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe lung
failure after a viral infection, the severity of the virus
infection is closely related to the maturity and binding
capacity of ACE2.27 Therefore, we supposed that a lower
level of ACE2 and weaker binding capacity with SARS-CoV-2
should be a major factor that leads to the absence of any
clinical manifestations for asymptomatic infections. It has
been reported that only a specific mild immune response is
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 invasion in asymptomatic
patients.28 However, more clinical samples should be
collected, and a relative examination of ACE2 should be
performed and compared for different types of COVID-19
cases, as this would be helpful to explain its pathogenesis.

Prevention and control
The main mode of transmission of COVID-19 is through
droplet and contact transmission and high-concentration
aerosols. Droplet transmission occurs when nearby people
ingest or inhale respiratory droplets (produced when an
infected person coughs or sneezes). The successful isolation
of live virus from throat swabs is a significant difference
from SARS, suggesting that viral replication in upper respiratory tissues is active and that SARS-CoV-2 is more
effective than SARS-CoV in spreading through active

A systematic review of asymptomatic infections
shedding of pharyngeal viruses.18 A German team found
that some people with COVID-19 had high levels of virus in
their throat swabs when their initial symptoms were mild,
meaning that the pathogen was quickly released and
transmitted to others by coughing or sneezing (droplet
transmission).29 This means that protective measures,
including wearing protective masks, can prevent infection
with new coronavirus to a certain extent.
Most people with an asymptomatic infection do not seek
medical assistance due to no obvious clinical signs and poor
prevention awareness. More epidemiological methods,
including close contact screening, cluster epidemic surveys,
and follow-up surveys of the source of infection, were used to
identify people with asymptomatic infections. The significance of asymptomatic infections as a source of infection
depends on the distribution in the population and the amount
and duration of virus elimination. However, clinical symptoms are hidden, and we can only rely on immunology or
nucleic acid detection technology to obtain information
about the infection; therefore, this kind of infectious source
cannot be effectively identified, making it very difficult to
prevent and control. Nucleic acid testing should be performed in persons who have contacted diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 patients. A person with an asymptomatic
infection should be quarantined for 14 days.22 After the
quarantine period expires, in principle, those who have
negative test results for two consecutive samples of nucleic
acid (sampling interval of at least 24 h) can be released from
quarantine. If symptoms occurred during quarantine, the
person should be admitted immediately. However, due to the
limitations of specimen collection and detection methods,
the influence of the high false-negative rate of the RT-PCR
should be paid attention to, which may lead to missed diagnosis or delay in effective diagnosis.30 For this purpose, the
combination of repeated nucleic acid detection and chest CT
imaging examination should be effectively carried out for
those highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections.31

Treatment and outcome
The latest guidelines from the Chinese health authorities
indicate,3 for the treatment of COVID-19, suspected and
confirmed cases should be treated in isolated hospitals with
effective isolation and protection conditions. Divided into
(1) general treatment: close monitoring of vital signs and
symptomatic support treatment. (2) antiviral therapy: patients with a positive nucleic acid test result can be given ainterferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine
phosphate, etc. (3) mechanical ventilation treatment and
rehabilitation plasma treatment for severe patients. (4)
traditional Chinese medicine treatment.
There is currently controversy regarding the treatment
of asymptomatic infections. Some researchers supported
that antiviral therapy could fasten viral clearance on
asymptomatic infections.20,24 While, it has been reported
that isolation and close observation are enough for
asymptomatic infections. In one report, lopinavir/ritonavir
and abidol were not reported to be effective in improving
symptoms or accelerating viral clearance.32 It was also reported that despite the treatment of aerosolized interferon
(IFN) a2b, and two tablets of lopinavir/ritonavir (200mg/

15
50 mg) were used twice a day for 10 days, viral nucleic acid
results were still positive, which showed that these antiviral drugs did not seem to be effective. In addition, side
effects were observed after antiviral therapy, such as liver
impairment.33 Therefore, antiviral treatments not suggested for asymptomatic infections now, maybe more
clinical studies are needed to further confirm its effectiveness. Until now, isolation and close observation are
regarded as a better option for these asymptomatic
infections.
A few people with an asymptomatic infection may
develop into symptomatic cases during isolation, but the vast
majority will heal on their own. A study of 24 asymptomatic
patients showed that all asymptomatic patients did not
develop severe disease or death, of which 18 (75.0%) were
virus cleared after antiviral treatment, 9 were discharged
from the hospital, and 9 were kept in the hospital for
observation. In particular, one case was positive again even
after the nucleic acid test negative for twice.20 They can only
be discharged after having at least two consecutive negative
nucleic acid test results (tested 24 h apart).2 Some patients
turn positive again after being discharged, so further isolation treatment and continuous nucleic acid testing can also
be recommended for discharged patients. It is recommended
to continue the isolation management, and health examinations should be continued for 14 days after being discharged, and regular follow-up visits should be conducted in
the 2nd and 4th weeks after being discharged.3

Conclusions
This manuscript reviewed the epidemiological characteristics and prevention measures of people with an asymptomatic infection of COVID-19. However, the research
evidence is very limited, and the specific characteristics of
asymptomatic infections need to be further clarified. In
summary, rigorous epidemiological investigations and laboratory testing are helpful in identifying people with
asymptomatic infection. To better prevent and control the
risk of COVID-19 disease, it is recommended to screen for
high-risk populations such as close contacts, especially in
one confined space with diagnosed or suspected infected
patients, which will be helpful for early control this global
epidemic effectively.
