Purpose: To compare the enhancement results of three gadolinium contrast agents in the inner ear of patients
with Meniere’s disease 4 h after intravenous injection of gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, or gadodiamide.
Methods: We enrolled 60 patients with a definitive diagnosis of unilateral Meniere’s disease and divided them
into three groups of 20 patients; each group received a double dose of gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, or
gadodiamide. The postcontrast signal intensity of the basal cochlear turn was scored quantitatively, and quali­
tative visual evaluation of the cochlea, vestibule and semi-circular canals was also performed. The results of both
evaluations were compared between the three patient groups.
Results: The cochlear basal turn signal intensity of the gadobutrol group was significantly higher than that of the
gadoterate meglumine and gadodiamide groups; however, no significant difference was observed between the
gadoterate meglumine and gadodiamide groups. The intensity of visualization of the semi-circular canals was
significantly better in the bilateral gadobutrol group than in the gadoterate meglumine and gadodiamide groups;
however, there was no significant difference in terms of the intensity of visualization of the semi-circular canals
between the gadoterate meglumine and gadodiamide groups. There were no significant differences in the in­
tensity of visualization of the cochlea and vestibule among the three groups.
Conclusions: Compared with gadoterate meglumine and gadodiamide, gadobutrol can provide a higher degree of
perilymphatic enhancement and better anatomical details of the semi-circular canals in the ears of patients with
Meniere’s disease.

1. Introduction
Meniere’s disease is a chronic disease with intermittent episodes of
vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness [1]. In
1938, endolymphatic hydrops was observed during autopsies of patients
with Meniere’s disease and is now known to be a pathological substrate
for the disease [2]. With developments in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), transtympanic and intravenous injection of gadolinium contrast
agent followed by MRI has made visualization of endolymphatic
hydrops possible [3–6]. Compared with transtympanic injection, intra­
venous injection does not require invasive puncture of the tympanic
membrane; indeed, intravenous injection is relatively harmless, and is
not affected by the round window membrane permeability [7].

Advantages of intravenous administration include a shorter delay be­
tween the administration and MRI and the ability to indirectly evaluate
the permeability of the blood-perilymphatic barrier [8]. Therefore,
although the change has been gradual, intravenous injection is now
being used extensively. Following intravenous injection of gadolinium
contrast agent, the contrast agent enters the perilymph through the
blood–perilymph barrier, causing the perilymph to appear as hyperin­
tense signals. However, as the contrast agent cannot penetrate the
blood–endolymph and endolymph–perilymph barriers, the endolymph
appears in the form of hypointense signals [9,10]. Currently, several
ionic and non-ionic gadolinium contrast agents are used for this purpose.
Gadobutrol, gadodiamide, and gadoterate meglumine are the
commonly used gadolinium contrast agents for MRI in clinical practice.

Fig. 1. Three 1-mm2 regions of interest were randomly selected at the perilymph of the bilateral cochlear base turns in areas with optimal visualization. A 50-mm2
region of interest was selected from the bilateral cerebellar white matter in the same slice.

Most gadolinium contrast agents can cause an adverse drug reaction
called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, the risk of which is higher in pa­
tients with severe kidney injury or acute renal impairment [11].
Therefore, attention must be paid to safety in addition to the enhance­
ment effects when selecting a contrast agent. Among the three contrast
agents used in this study, gadodiamide has a non-ionic linear structure,
whereas gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine have macrocyclic
structures. Because the stability of macrocyclic structures is higher than
that of non-ionic linear structures, free gadolinium does not easily occur
in nature. Previous researchers injected different doses of gadodiamide,
gadobutrol, and gadoterate meglumine into rats and found that the
amount of gadodiamide deposited in the skin of rats was significantly
higher than that of gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine, with some
rats showing a nephrogenic systemic fibrosis-like presentation [12].
Owing to differences in the physicochemical characteristics of the
numerous gadolinium contrast agents, different contrast agents may
have different enhancement results at the same site [13,14]. Anzalone
et al. found that the image quality obtained on enhanced MRI scanning
of brain tumours after intravenous injection of gadobutrol was consid­
erably better than that obtained after intravenous injection of gado­
terate meglumine [15]. Moreover, Saake et al. found that in patients
with multiple sclerosis, the signal intensity of gadobutrol-enhanced MRI
was higher than that of gadoterate meglumine-enhanced MRI [16].
Studies have also shown that the use of different gadolinium contrast
agents for inner ear enhanced scanning may lead to different enhance­
ment results [17,18]. In the current study, the enhancement results of
three gadolinium contrast agents in the inner ear of patients with
Meniere’s disease were compared by MRI scans 4 h after intravenous
injection of gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, or gadodiamide.

agents, sensorineural deafness, otitis media, or ear surgery. We chose
patients with a “definite” diagnosis of unilateral Meniere’s disease based
on the 2015 diagnostic criteria formulated by the American Academy of
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery [19]. All of the included pa­
tients had visited the otolaryngology outpatient clinic of our Hospital
from March 2019 to August 2020. Sixty patients were ultimately
included in this study and were divided into three groups as follows:
gadobutrol (n = 20, 7 men and 13 women; 7 left and 13 right ears;
age:56.4 ± 8.1 year; duration of the disease:4.6 ± 4.9 year), gadodia­
mide (n = 20, 9 men and 11 women; 11 left and 9 right ears;
age:50.8 ± 12.3 year; duration of the disease:2.6 ± 3.2 year), and gado­
terate meglumine (n = 20, 10 men and 10 women; 13 left and 7 right
ears; age:54.5 ± 13.6 year; duration of the disease:4.0 ± 4.7 year). All
patients had persistent tinnitus, intermittent vertigo, and hearing loss.
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of our
Hospital(2018-298-2). All patients signed the informed consent form.
2.2. MRI scan and intravenous injection of gadolinium contrast agent
A 0.2 ml/kg double dose of gadobutrol (7.5 ml/vial, 1.0 mmol/mL;
Bayer AG) was administered to 20 patients. A 0.4 ml/kg double dose of
gadodiamide (15 ml/vial, 0.5 mmol/mL; General Electric, Inc) was
administered to 20 patients. A 0.4 ml/kg double dose of gadoterate
meglumine (15 ml/vial, 0.5 mmol/mL; Guerbet France) was adminis­
tered to 20 patients. A 3 T MRI scanner (SIGNA Pioneer 3.0 T; GE, Inc.)
and a 21-channel head coil were used for three-dimensional fluidattenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) sequence scanning 4 h after
the injection.
Prior to gadolinium injection, head T2 FLAIR scan (repetition time
(TR), 9,000 ms; echo time (TE), 95 ms; inversion time (TI), 2,468 ms;

gadolinium was injected, a 3D-FLAIR sequence scan (TR, 9,000 ms; TE,
189 ms; TI, 2,134 ms; slice thickness, 1 mm; matrix size, 320 × 320;

eration factor, 4; scan time, 10 min and 52 s) was performed. None of the
patients moved during the scan.
2.3. Image analysis
The 3-grade classification criteria proposed by Nakashima et al. were
used as a reference for evaluating cochlear and vestibular endolym­
phatic hydrops and classifying it into mild, moderate, or significant
grades [20].
Based on the method of Shi et al. [21], we randomly selected three
1-mm2 regions of interest from bilateral cochlear basal turns with
optimal visualization and measured the mean signal intensity of these
three regions. We also selected one 50-mm2 region of interest at each
side of the cerebellar white matter in the same layer (Fig. 1) and
calculated the ratio of the mean signal intensity on the affected and
healthy side’s cochlear basal turn perilymph over the cerebellar white
matter signal intensity on the same side. The signal intensity ratio was
used to represent the degree of perilymph enhancement. Two experi­
enced radiologists conducted double-blinded measurements of the im­
ages from all patients, and the mean values of measurements from these
two physicians were calculated.
We also conducted two-grade visual evaluation of the degree of
enhancement at the cochlea, vestibule, and semi-circular canals (grade
0, blurry visualization; grade 1, significant visualization). Two experi­
enced diagnostic radiology physicians conducted double-blinded mea­
surements and diagnosis of the images from all patients. Discussion was
held between the physicians when there was a difference in results until
a consensus was reached.

P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Independent sample analysis was used to analyse the differences in age
and weight among the three groups. P values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
3. Results
There were no significant differences in the clinical features among
the three groups (Table 1). Based on the 3-grade classification criteria
developed by Nakashima et al., there were no significant differences in
cochlear hydrops and vestibular hydrops among the three groups (Ta­
bles 2 and 6). The interference of other factors on signal intensity was
excluded.
The signal intensities in the affected ear in the gadobutrol, gado­
diamide, and gadoterate meglumine groups were as follows: me­
dian = 5.37, Q1 = 4.75, Q3 = 6.36, range = 4.51–8.44; median = 3.84,
Q1 = 3.25, Q3 = 5.23, range = 2.00–6.66; and median = 3.89,
Q1 = 3.44, Q3 = 4.25, range = 2.69–6.13, respectively. The signal in­
tensities in the healthy ear in the gadobutrol, gadodiamide, and gado­
terate meglumine groups were as follows: median = 3.90, Q1 = 3.59,
Q3 = 4.53, range = 3.04–7.08; median = 3.21, Q1 = 2.70, Q3 = 3.87,
range = 1.91–5.84; and median = 3.40, Q1 = 2.87, Q3 = 3.90,
range = 2.17–5.37, respectively (Table 3). The results of Kruskal–Wallis
analysis showed that there were significant differences in the cochlear
base turn intensity ratio among the three groups (affected ear,

2.4. Data analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY). Normally distributed data were expressed as
mean ± standard deviation, and non-normally distributed data were
expressed as median. The Kruskal–Wallis H test was used to analyse the
differences in bilateral ear signal intensity ratio and clinical features
(duration of tinnitus, duration of vertigo; low tone, middle tone, high
tone) among the three groups. Fisher’s exact probability test was used to
analyse the differences in visual evaluation among the three groups.

probability results showed that the affected side’s semi-circular canal
visualization in the gadobutrol group was better than that in the gado­

ferences in visual evaluation of the cochlea and vestibule among the
three groups (P > 0.05).

shorten the tissue T1 relaxation time, and the ability to shorten the T1
relaxation time is affected by the concentration and relaxation rate of
the contrast agent. If the tissue concentration or the relaxation rate of
the contrast agent is higher, the ability to shorten the T1 relaxation time
is stronger, and a better quality image is obtained as a result. The con­
centration of gadobutrol used in this study was 1.0 mmol/L, and that of
gadodiamide and gadoterate meglumine was 0.5 mmol/L. Thus, the
concentration of gadobutrol was twice that of the other contrast agents.
Injection of leading to greater effects in local contrast agent level, and
more contrast agent molecules will carry out their effect in local tissues.
In this study, there were no significant differences in weight between the
three groups, and double doses were used for all contrast agents; this
resulted in a higher concentration of gadobutrol compared to the other
contrast agents. The relaxation rate refers to the quantitative value of
relaxation time that is shortened by the MRI contrast agent under
standard conditions. Studies have shown that the relaxation rate of
gadobutrol is higher than that of gadodiamide and gadoterate meglu­
mine in a field strength range of 0.47–4.7 T [22]. As the concentration
and relaxation rate of gadobutrol are both higher than those of gado­
diamide and gadoterate meglumine, gadobutrol can significantly
shorten the tissue T1 relaxation time, leading to better quality can be
obtained images. This study showed that the measured signal intensities
in the basal turn of the cochlea in the gadobutrol group were higher than
those in the gadodiamide and gadoterate meglumine groups. Eliezer
et al. found that in the asymptomatic ear of patients with Meniere’s
disease, gadobutrol showed higher signal intensity than gadoterate
meglumine [17]. This result is consistent with the results of the current
study.
However, Eliezer et al. also found that the signal intensity of the
symptomatic ear in the gadobutrol group was not significantly different
to that of the gadoterate meglumine group [17], which is not consistent
with the results of our study. One reason for this discrepancy may be that
although our study showed no significant difference in the degree of
cochlear and vestibular endolymphatic hydrops among the three groups
(Table 5), the ratio of patients with moderate to significant endolym­
phatic hydrops in the gadobutrol group (cochlea: 75 %, vestibula: 80 %)
was higher than that of the gadodiamide (cochlea: 65 %, vestibula: 65
%) and gadoterate meglumine (cochlea: 60 %, vestibula: 60 %) groups.
Moreover, previous studies have shown that the permeability of the
blood–labyrinth barrier is positively correlated with the severity of
endolymphatic hydrops [23], the signal intensity in the basal turn of the
cochlea in the affected ear is higher than the unaffected ear [24,25].The
severity of endolymphatic hydrops in the gadobutrol group was higher
than that in the other two groups in the current study, resulting in
increased blood–labyrinth barrier permeability. This causes the con­
centration of contrast agent in the perilymph to be higher and can
explain the higher affected ear signal intensity in the gadobutrol group
compared with the other two groups.
Our study found that visualization of the semi-circular canals in both
ears in the gadobutrol group was better than that in the gadodiamide
and gadoterate meglumine groups; this finding is consistent with the
study of Eliezer who found that semi-circular canal visualization in the
gadobutrol group was better than that in the gadoterate meglumine
group [17]. This can be explained by the fact that the concentration and
relaxation rate of gadobutrol are higher than those of gadoterate
meglumine. In addition, we found no significant differences in cochlear
and vestibular visualization among the three contrast agent groups. This
may be because of the anatomy of the inner ear as the arteries of the
inner ear are mainly located at the cochlea and vestibule. After intra­
venous injection with contrast agent, the contrast agent enters the
perilymph through the blood–labyrinth barrier. The contrast agent is
mostly distributed in the cochlea and vestibule. The differences in
cochlear and vestibular distribution of the contrast agent between the
three groups may be less than ideal because double doses of contrast
agents were injected.
Our study has some limitations. First, we did not measure signal

intensity and conduct visual evaluation for the three types of gadolinium
contrast agents in the same patient. Previous studies have shown that
blood–labyrinth barrier permeability is positively correlated with the
severity of endolymphatic hydrops [23]. Therefore, the signal intensity
in the affected ear may be affected as a result of the different severities of
endolymphatic hydrops in different patients. However, measurements of
three different contrast agents in the same patient are not a clinical
necessity, and we ensured that there was no significant difference in the
severity of endolymphatic hydrops among the three groups, which
weakens this limitation.
Compared with gadoterate meglumine and gadodiamide, gadobutrol
can provide a higher degree of perilymphatic enhancement and better
anatomical details of the semi-circular canals in the bilateral ears of
patients with Meniere’s disease.
