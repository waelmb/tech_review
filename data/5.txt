1. Introduction
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of
1994 classifies herbs as dietary supplements (Dietary [4,11–15].
Dietary supplements can be produced, sold, and marketed without
first demonstrating safety and efficacy, as is required for pharmaceutical drugs (Dietary [4]. Because herbs are plants, they are often
perceived as ‘‘natural” and therefore safe ([5,9,10]. Table 1.Table 2.
Table 3.Table 4.Fig. 1.

2 bottles of the herbal preparation free of charge for each one and
were learn the methods of administration, the herbal drug mixture
every day for 12 days.
4. Exclusion criteria included
Note: previously we used this drug formula in the treatment of
pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, severe seasonal flu, and
after the occurrence of COVID19 pandemic, we developed the formula to treat the COVID19. (Alhayani, B. 2014)

2. The herbal formula
The novel formula was created by combining 7 herbs (Tetraclinis
articulate, eucalyptus, thymus vulgaris, syzygium aromaticum, illicium
verum, boswellia carterii, mentha) that have commonly been used in
the prevention and treatment of different diseases. >14 ingredients noted in the modern herbal pharmacopoeia to have strong
antiviral properties were in the components of drug. The entire drug
formula therefore consisted of 7 herbs. (Alhayani, B. 2017)
3. Subjects and data collection methods
Volunteer’s patients who were diagnosed by respiratory disease
specialist were recruited for the study. the study patients received

4.1. Detection of the drug components
Drug materials were obtained from traditional medicine suppliers in Iraq.
4.2. Pre-clinical experiment: Safety of drug preparation
4.2.1. Median lethal dose (LD50)
Thirty adult female albino BALB/C mice (6–8 weeks, range of
body weight = 20–25 g, 4 mice in each group) were used to determine the S/C median lethal dose (LD50) of drug (aqueous extracts).
The animals were kept in well air-condition rooms at the private
animal house, given pellets of balanced specially prepared animal
feed and water.Graded doses of drug extracts in 0.1 ml PBS were
administered orally to each one animal daily, a series of concentrations of local herb extract employed by ([32].).(Alhayani, B.2020)

The aquoues-ethanolic extract, and 50 gms of the herb gave 15
gms of dark yellow extract 30% yield.
5.1. Identification of herbal drug constituents
The aquoues-ethanolic extract
Thirty one compounds were identified by GC/MS .
5.2. Pri-clinical study
Although the components of the herbal drug are within the permissible FDA regulations and provide global studies related the
safety of the components of the herbal drug, however we have
studied the toxicity of the drug on laboratory animals.
Median Lethal Dose (LD50):
LD50 = Xf + Kd
Xf = Latest dose used, k = table value
d = amount of increase and decrease in a given dose
LD50 = 5000 + (1.000  500)
LD50 (Aqueous extract) = 5500 mg/kg body Wt.
5.3. Clinical trial
The data in the table (3) revealed that the most of patient were
recovered, and there was a highly significant difference among the
recovered patient in comparison with pre-treatment patients at
P < 0.03) in both treated group (pneumonia & severe flu)
respectively.
The results in table (4) showed that all the treated patients were
completely recovered in spite of non-significant difference
between pre-treated and recovered patients.

4.3. Clinical trial
4.3.1. Test Product, dose and mode of administration
Drug materials were obtained from traditional medicine suppliers in Iraq, 3.5gm of herbal drug mixture was boiled in 150 ml
water, taken 4 times daily and other part taken as inhalation by
nebulizer 4–7 time daily depending on severity of disease.

6. Discussion
Already the interested novel herbal drug has been used by a
group of patients suffering from pneumonia with severe respiratory distress, as well as patients with severe seasonal flu. The
data in tables (3) reveals that there were a highly incidence of
healing as a results of herbal drug treatment with no side effect,
and most of the patients were completely returns to their good
health within 3–9 days, the improvement in the clinical situation
began with the first doses of treatment .
The good news is that this novel herbal drug has been tested in
volunteer’s patients with COVID19. The preliminary results
showed its effective effect in eradicating the COVID19 in short
period.
The characteristic composition of this herbal drug makes it
effective in treating respiratory disease, especially COVID19.
The GC/MS data cleared that the interested herbal drug contains
a cocktail of compounds that works in different mechanism. The
effectiveness of the interested novel herbal drug in eradicating
the respiratory viruses especially novel corona virus is due to contains many well-known pleiotropic antiviral compounds.

4.3.2. Methodology
1. Ten patients with COVID19, age ranged (25–70 years); 12 days
for each course treatment, a randomized study to examine efficacy of herbal drug in patients with COVID19.
2. Twenty five patients with pneumonia suffering from severe respiratory distress, age ranged (15–45 years); 12 days for each
course treatment, a randomized study to examine efficacy of
drug preparation.
3. Thirty one patients with severe seasonal flu, age ranged (15–
47 years); 12 days for each course treatment, a randomized
study to examine efficacy of herbal drug .
The whole time of study was 8 month from (February 2019march 2020).(Alhayani, B.2020)

stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-b that possibly contributed
to counteracting viral infection of human respiratory syncytial
virus in human respiratory tract cell lines [3] B ([19]. The bpinene has high macrophage immunomodulatory efficacies and
therefore contributes in killing bronchitis viruses (Lumaret et al.,
2001).
By the other hand the presence of ɑ-terpineol and thujone
which induce leukocyte and cytokine, increases antibody response
against virus ([2]. A phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes like cbisabolene, b-caryophelene, farnesol and b-eudesmol that present
in herbal drug directly inactivate herpes virus and might interfere
with virion envelope structures or mask viral structures that are
necessary for adsorption or entry into host cells ([29]. Also the curcumin compound in the herbal drug formula inhibits severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus ([33] and rhinovirus ([27]. The
allylguaiacol compound present in the drug formula showed significant inhibitory activity against HCV protease ([7].
The shikimic acid present in the drug formula which is considered a starting material for the synthesis of Tamiflu will inhibit
neuraminidase and contribute in eradication of swine flu virus
H1N1 ([26] & McKimm 2013) .
The anti-inflammatory effects of interested drug is due to presence so many compounds; Carvacrol present in herbal drug may
inhibit production of prostaglandin E2
Furthermore , the presence of many compounds in the drug formula like curcumin ,ɑ-limonene ([1].
The bronchodilatory effect of herbal drug is due to contains
many compound which led to relaxation of smooth muscles in
bronchi ([20] and Oluwagbemiga et al.,2017).
The novel herbal drug also contains many compounds work as
sedative, anxiolytic and relieve panic condition that may affect
the patients with COVID19 (Ka Young et al., 2014; Diogo
et al.,2019 ; [6] .
Finally the herbal drug contains many compound acts as
antibacterial that may eradicate the opportunistic bacteria that
infect COVID19 patients ([45] ; Sedarnawati et al.,2009)

The virus particle have 2 surface antigen, The enzyme neuraminidase (NA) is an attractive target for antiviral strategy due
to its essential role in the pathogenicity of many respiratory
viruses (Serkedjieva et al., 2007).
The kampferol a compound of the herbal drug is the most
famous antiviral compound which neutralize and reduce the infectivity of influenza viruses A and B ([8] . Also the drug contains a
Myricetin which considered a SARS–CoV helicase inhibitor (Yu,
et al., 2012) . The gingerol and zingerone were inhibited of virus
cell infusion and prevent viral replication of H1N1 and also could
