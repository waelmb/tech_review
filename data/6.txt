Objectives: The efficacy of intratympanic steroid (ITS) injection for intractable Meniere's disease has been re­
ported; however, its differences in responsiveness are not fully understood. This study investigated the clinical
characteristics of patients who responded to ITS injection treatment.
Methods: This retrospective study included 32 patients with Meniere's disease who were unable to control
frequent vertigo attacks despite conservative treatment for at least 3 months. They received an intratympanic
injection of dexamethasone (3.3 mg/mL) in the affected side at least three times. We measured hearing threshold,
subjective symptom scores, cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP and oVEMP), and
performed glycerol and bithermal caloric tests.
Results: Satisfactory control of vertigo for 1 year after the first round of injection was found in 18 patients (56.3%;
the response group). However, the injections failed to control vertigo in the other 14 patients (43.8%; the nonresponse group), and they were then treated with middle ear micropressure therapy. The response group showed
improvement in low-frequency hearing, whereas hearing acuity did not change in the non-response group.
Significantly reduced amplitude of cVEMP on the affected side was found in 62.5% of patients in the response
group; however, no patients in the non-response group showed reduced amplitude of cVEMP.
Conclusions: ITS injection significantly improved the subjective symptoms for intractable Meniere's disease;
however, the long-term effects were heterogeneous. Our results suggest that reduced amplitude in cVEMP is
associated with the effectiveness of ITS injection treatment.

1. Introduction
Patients with Meniere's disease suffer from frequent vertigo attacks,
progressive hearing loss, tinnitus, and ear fullness. The common path­
ological condition is endolymphatic hydrops arising in the cochlea and
vestibule; however, pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. It has
often been proposed that Meniere's disease is an immunoinflammatory
illness in the endolymphatic sac [1–3]. Initial conservative treatment
includes improving lifestyle and diet, with drug therapy such as di­
uretics, antivertigo drugs, or antianxiety drugs. Patients with intractable
Meniere's disease who fail to control vertigo using conservative treat­
ment have experienced invasive treatments including surgical

endolymphatic sac drainage, intratympanic injection of gentamicin, and
vestibular neurectomy [4,5]. Recently, the efficacy of intratympanic
steroid (ITS) injection for intractable Meniere's disease has been re­
ported, and it is considered as an option preceding more invasive
treatment in the clinical practice guideline of the American Academy of
Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) [6].
ITS injection is a treatment method whereby steroids are adminis­
tered via the tympanic cavity. The goal is to reach the inner ear with a
higher concentration of medication compared with systemic adminis­
tration [7]. However, the therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Hy­
pothetically, an anti-inflammatory action is induced by changing the
gene expression of the cochlea and vestibule, with action to improve

cochlear blood flow and to enhance the expression of the lymph ho­
meostasis regulatory factor aquaporin [8–10].
The long-term effectiveness of ITS injections for intractable Meniere's
disease has been described in various reports [11–18]. However, the
success rates of controlling vertigo are heterogeneous. Few articles have
discussed the characteristics of responders and non-responders to ITS
injection. In this study, we considered the differences in responsiveness
of ITS injection treatment on the basis of the characteristics of clinical
course and various physiological examinations.

We determined the average hearing threshold at 125, 250, and 500
Hz defined it as the low-frequency range, the average at 500, 1000,
2000, and 3000 Hz as the mid-frequency range, and the average at 2000,
4000, and 8000 Hz as the high-frequency range. The hearing examina­
tion was recorded every month from pre-treatment to post-ITS injection
treatment until the observation was completed.
VEMP was evaluated using the amplitude of the affected side (Aa)
and amplitude of the unaffected side (Au) to calculate the asymmetry
ratio expressed as asymmetry ratio (%) = 100|(Aa − Au)| / |(Aa + Au)|.
Based on guidelines and previous reports of normal asymmetry ratios
[20–22], an asymmetry ratio of >33% in cVEMP and an asymmetry ratio
of >50% in oVEMP were considered to indicate significantly reduced
amplitude.
For the glycerol test, the results were considered positive when a
threshold improvement of 10 dB or more was observed in two or more
ranges.
As to bithermal caloric test, Jongkees's formula was used to deter­
mine semicircular canal paresis (CP) using the maximum slow-phase
velocity (with a 25% difference in CP being considered significant).
VEMP, glycerol test, and bithermal caloric test were examined before
the treatment.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
This retrospective study included 32 patients who were definitively
diagnosed with Meniere's disease based on the diagnostic criteria of the
AAO-HNS and Barany Society [19]. They visited our hospital after initial
conservative treatment failed to control their vertigo for at least 3
months between November 2018 and November 2019. The observation
period was set to 12 months. No patient had a previous history of other
disease and drug administration affecting hearing and vestibular func­
tion. The study was approved by the institutional review board of our
hospital (approval number: 2020-227).

2.4. Statistical analysis

2.2. Treatments

The statistical significance of the difference between before and after
ITS injection was determined using a paired t-test. Fisher's exact test and
two-tailed unpaired t-test were applied to evaluate characteristic dif­
ferences between responders and non-responders. Values of p < 0.05
were considered significant. The illustrated values are shown as the
mean ± 1 standard error (se).

All patients received ITS injection as a second-line treatment. A pa­
tient was placed in a semi-sitting 45-degree position with the affected
ear facing upward. Approximately 0.5 mL dexamethasone solution (3.3
mg/mL) was injected into the tympanic cavity near the posterosuperior
quadrant of the tympanic membrane. The patient remained in the supine
position without swallowing for 30 min. Injection was administered
three times on consecutive days or in one–two week intervals. When the
patient became aware of the therapeutic effect and requested the readministration of ITS injection to maintain good condition, we admin­
istered the injection once. When patients observed no change in the
control of vertigo attacks by ITS injection and requested other treat­
ment, transtympanic middle ear pressure treatment was provided.

3. Results
Participants included 32 patients with a median age of 64.5 years
(range: 26–82 years), and there were 13 males and 19 females (Table 2).
Regarding the treatment outcome, 18 of 32 patients (56.3%) were
responders. In 13 responders, improvement was maintained with the
initial injection treatment alone. One additional injection was admin­
istered in four patients, and two additional injections were administered
in one patient. They all achieved good control of vertigo attacks for 1
year. Non-responders included 14 patients (43.8%). Ten patients
showed no improvement in symptoms with the initial treatment and
quickly received transtympanic middle ear pressure treatment. Four
patients exhibited a temporary improvement in symptoms following the
initial treatment but subsequently experienced re-exacerbation of
symptoms. These non-responders received one additional ITS injections
with no improvement in symptoms, and they then received trans­
tympanic middle ear pressure treatment. No instances of adverse events,
such as tympanic membrane perforation, were observed during followup.
Fig. 1 presents the changes in symptom scores. Upon examining the
overall mean scores for the 32 patients at the completion of the followup observation, levels of all four categories of symptoms were signifi­
cantly reduced. Changes in the average scores in vertigo, distress, ac­
tivity, and tinnitus from pre-treatment to the end of the observation
were from 23.1 to 8.1, from 32.0 to 12.7, from 26.5 to 8.8, and from 46.1

2.3. Main outcome measures
Patients were considered responders if symptom improvement could
be maintained by ITS injection alone for 1 year, and they were consid­
ered non-responders if treatment was changed to transtympanic middle
ear pressure treatment during the observation period.
We measured subjective symptom scores, hearing threshold, cervical
and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP and oVEMP),
and performed glycerol and bithermal caloric tests.
Patients kept a daily record of symptom scores. Symptoms were
scored according to a five-point scale of 0–4 points for the levels of
following four items: vertigo, distress, activity, and tinnitus (Table 1).
For symptom scores recorded from 1 month before treatment until the
completion of the follow-up observation period, the total of each score
was calculated each month, and changes were recorded.

The AAO-HNS Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium Guidelines for
the diagnosis and evaluation of therapy in Meniere's disease is often used
for evaluating therapeutic outcomes. These criteria determine a nu­
merical value expressed in percentage ((mean number of vertigo attacks
for 18–24 months after treatment / mean number of vertigo attacks for 6
months before treatment) × 100) [23]. Regarding the effectiveness of
ITS injections for intractable Meniere's disease, the success rate of con­
trolling vertigo attacks at 2 years after the start of treatment (numerical
value of ≦1) ranged from 15.1% to 91% in a mini-review previously
reported by Miteth, indicating considerable variation [24]. This was
attributed to differences in the methodology of the ITS injection,
including the type, number of injections, and concentration of steroid.
Additionally, the definition of “vertigo attacks” depends on the subjec­
tive symptoms of the individual patient regardless of the degree of
vertigo. The symptom scores used in our study defined the level of

Our study showed that there were significantly more responders than
non-responders with low cVEMP amplitude in the initial objective test
findings. However, there was no significant difference in the results of
oVEMP. In Meniere's disease, cVEMP reflects the formation of hydrops in
the sacculus, whereas oVEMP reflects the formation of hydrops in the
utricle [25]. We believe that most patients in the responsive group could
have presented with endolymphatic hydrops primarily in the sacculus.
The transtympanically injected steroids mainly reach the inner ear via
the round window [2,3]; thus, there are two conceivable pathways for
steroids to reach the vestibule after passing through the round window.
First, for a pathway via the membranous labyrinth, the steroids infiltrate
scala media in the process of passing from the scala tympani to the scala
vestibuli, and then, the steroids pass through the canalis reuniens to
disperse into the endolymphatic spaces of each vestibular tissue. Second,
for a pathway via the osseous labyrinth, the steroids that have moved
from the scala tympani to the scala vestibuli disperse into the osseous
labyrinth of the vestibule and infiltrate the endolymphatic spaces of
each vestibular organ. In previous animal experiments, the concentra­
tion of steroids reaching each fluid was simultaneously measured after
intratympanic injection of dexamethasone, including the scala tympani
perilymph, vestibular scala perilymph, and scala media endolymph. The
concentration in the scala media endolymph was close to six-fold greater
than that in the scala tympani perilymph and the scala vestibuli peri­
lymph [26]. Thus, the therapeutic mechanism of the ITS injection may
be mainly associated with the pathway via the membranous labyrinth.
The sacculus is located immediately after passing through the canalis
reuniens from the scala vestibuli, the utricle is in the site passing through
the endolymphatic duct and utriculosaccular duct from the sacculus,
whereas the semicircular canal is more distally located. Hence, the
transtympanic steroid injection may easily penetrate with high con­
centration via the membranous labyrinth in patients with Meniere's with
large hydrops in the sacculus. We suggest that cases with low amplitude
of cVEMP are highly responsive to ITS injection compared with those
without low amplitude cVEMP.
Furthermore, conservative treatment of Meniere's disease that de­
pends on blood circulation to the inner ear, such as transvenous infusion
and oral therapy, may be affected by individual differences, such as

vertigo not only on the basis of the presence or absence of attacks but
also on basis of the duration and symptoms of each attack. Recording the
scores each day was helpful for quantitatively evaluating vertigo
symptoms and the efficacy of treatment. Furthermore, we noted a sig­
nificant difference in the score ratio at 1 month after the start of treat­
ment for 1-year outcome of ITS injection. Accordingly, monthly followup using symptom scores is useful for relatively quickly estimating the
mid- to long-term effects of ITS injection by comparing the symptom
scores each month. We can proactively change to second-line treatment
in patients who quickly appear to be unresponsive to treatment.

Regarding auditory acuity, responders tended to have somewhat
lower pre-treatment auditory acuity thresholds compared with the un­
responsive group for all frequency ranges (Table 4).
Table 5 presents the comparison of age, VEMP, glycerol test, and
caloric test results. There was no clear difference in age between re­
sponders and non-responders. Regarding cVEMP, reduced amplitude
was observed in five of eight patients in the responders, whereas none of
the six non-responders showed reduced amplitude (p < 0.05). There was
no difference between responders and non-responders in terms of other

aging and osmotic pressure in blood associated with decreased kidney
function [27]. Given these mechanisms, we considered that ITS injection
has the potential to achieve a localized pharmacological action, even in
patients in whom drug delivery to the inner ear is hindered because of a
peripheral circulation disorder.
In recent years, inner ear contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) has enabled separate evaluation of the location and level
of endolymphatic hydrops of the cochlea and vestibule in patients with
Meniere's disease [28], and several reports have emerged on the rela­
tionship between MRI findings and the results of laboratory tests
[29–32]. When severe hydrops in the vestibule are observed on MRI, it is
believed to be caused by reduced VEMP amplitude [32]. Combining
contrast-enhanced MRI findings of the inner ear with the findings of
these physiological function tests may enable a more detailed evaluation
of the localization and level of endolymphatic hydrops, as well as the
therapeutic effects of ITS injection.
The present study has several limitations. First, the observation
period in our study was relatively short, and it was difficult to compare
its effectiveness with other literature based on the criteria of the AAOHNS for determining therapeutic outcomes [23]. Second, we focused
on the differences in the proportion of patients with reduced cVEMP
amplitude in the responders and non-responders. However, the number
of patients in our study was small. Third, patients showing bilateral
hyporesponse of cVEMP were included in the group without low
amplitude of cVEMP. If latent endolymphatic hydrops were present in
the unaffected side, cVEMP results would be false negative. It may be
preferable to verify the presence or absence of hydrops by contrastenhanced MRI of the inner ear.

5. Conclusions
Our results suggest that ITS injection treatment with follow-up
observation using daily symptom scores is useful for early prediction
of the mid- to long-term therapeutic effect after the start of the treat­
ment. It is also useful to determine changes in the intensity of the
treatment for intractable Meniere's disease. Furthermore, we suggest
that ITS injection is more effective for controlling vertigo attacks when
endolymphatic hydrops is present mainly in the sacculus. The effec­
tiveness of ITS injection can be predicted before treatment based on
reduced cVEMP amplitude.
