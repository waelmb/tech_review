Ménière’s disease is an inner ear disease with attacks characterized by ear fullness, tinnitus,
fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo. Although pathophysiology of the disease is not
fully known, endolymphatic hydrops are believed to play a role. Although there is no certain
treatment procedure for Ménière’s disease, some treatments are applied to prevent attacks, to
treat the symptoms that occur during the attacks, and to prevent the permanent effects of the
symptoms on the hearing and balance system. Lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, diuretics,
vasodilator corticosteroids, intratympanic steroids, surgical methods are some of these treatment
methods. Dietary modification includes a low sodium diet, a reduction in daily alcohol and
caffeine intake, a gluten-free diet, and a new dietary approach to specially processed grains, all
of which are first-line treatments. The goal of this review article is to examine the relationship
between MD and dietary intervention, which is frequently used in the prevention and treatment
of MD attacks.

1. Introduction
Ménière’s disease (MD) is an idiopathic inner ear disorder characterized by spontaneous recurrent vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, aural fullness and tinnitus [1].
Ménière’s disease is more common in Caucasians, individuals
between the ages of 40–60, and women [2,3]. Although less
common, MD can also affect children [4].
Precisely determining the population-level incidence and
prevalence of the disease and establishing relationships with
potential risk factors is a challenge given the limited number
of epidemiological studies of Ménière’s disease. In a largescale study conducted in the USA in 2010, the prevalence
of Ménière’s disease was determined to be 200 per 100,000

people [5]. Epidemiological studies have shown a genetic predisposition for MD [6].
The MD classification is divided into 4 groups as certain,
definite, probable, possible MD and 2 groups as definite and
probable according to the last classification defined by Barany
Society in 2015 as seen in Table l [7].
Ménière’s disease can be unilateral or bilateral, and both
ears are affected in 25–40% of the cases [7,8].
The possibility of bilateral occurrence and symptoms of
the disease increase with age. While the possibility of unilateral MD to be bilateral in the first 10 years is 35% or
more, this rate is 47% in MD lasting 20 years [1]. MD impose a huge burden on the patients and reduces the ability to work due to severe hearing loss and chronic balance
problems [7,8].
Typical histopathological finding of MD is endolymphatic
hydrops. Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) is thought to be caused
by decreased absorption, increased production, or both of endolymph. It is believed that there is a relationship between

the disruption of homeostatic mechanisms that maintain fluid
and electrolyte balance in the inner ear and endolymph accumulation [2].
Studies suggest that EH has a causal relationship with
Ménière’s, but requires additional cofactors (viral infection,
allergy, etc.) to become symptomatic [9].
Ménière’s disease treatment consists of reducing attacks,
relieving symptoms, and preventing permanent damage to
hearing and balance structures. Lifestyle changes, diuretics,
vasodilators, corticosteroids, intratympanic therapy and surgical treatment methods are preferred. The first-line treatment
commonly includes dietary modification and lifestyle changes
such as restriction of salt, caffeine, alcohol intake, reduction
of stress and anxiety and several drugs [10]. Although there
is no complete recovery in this disease, which has worsened
with the progression of sensorineural hearing loss over the
years, it has been reported that more than 85% of patients
with Ménière’s disease improve with lifestyle changes and
medical or surgical treatment [11]. Dietary changes, including low salt diet, caffeine, and alcohol intake, are commonly
recommended for people with Ménière’s disease [12]. It is
clinically known that dietary changes are generally helpful
in preventing disease progression [7]. A reduced sodium and
caffeine-free diet was used in a study conducted to evaluate
compliance and willingness to dietary changes in the treatment of vertigo in individuals with Ménière’s disease. It has
been shown in the study that nutrition can play an important
role in the treatment of this disease [8].
The aim of this review article is to examine the relationship
between MD and dietary intervention, which is frequently
used in the prevention and treatment of MD attacks.
2. Low sodium and Ménière’s disease
The salt-reduced diet has been used frequently as the first
option in the treatment of MD since the 1930s [13]. While
there is no sodium recommendation specifically for patients
with MD, in the American Dietary Guideline published for
the years 2020–2025, it has been suggested that daily sodium
intake should be below 2300mg for individuals aged 14 and
over [14]. High salt intake is one of the factors of acute exacerbation of MD symptoms [15]. Data obtained from animals and humans showed that the low-salt diet made almost
no changes in plasma sodium levels and that sodium levels were normal even in those whose presence of endolymphatic hydrops was proved histopathologically. These findings

show that the relationship between endolymphatic hydrops
and sodium levels is more complex than thought [16].
Salt reduction is associated with a physiological increase
in plasma aldosterone level [17]. Studies have shown that
aldosterone increases the endolymph absorption in the inner
ear [18,19]. Mineral corticoid receptors are identified in the
endolymphatic sac. In addition, epithelial Na+ channels,
which are claimed to be controlled by Na+ /K+ -ATPase,
thiazide sensitive Na+ Cl− cotransporter and aldosterone,
are also expressed in the endolymphatic sac [19,20,21] The
endolymphatic sac has high Na permeability and Na+ /K+ ATPase activity. This potentially contributes to endolymph
absorption [19]. Therefore, in patients with MD, elevations
in aldosterone levels due to a low-salt diet can increase
endolymphatic absorption within the endolymphatic sac and
ameliorate endolymphatic hydrops, a characteristic feature of
MD.
13 patients with MD were given a low-salt diet (2 g Na /
day) for 2 years, initially 24 h urine samples were collected,
and urine samples were collected at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks and 6,
12, 18 and 24 months after initiating this diet. Besides plasma
osmotic pressure, aldosterone, cortisol, hormones (including
anti-diuretic hormone), Na, K and Cl in the blood were measured. In the study, it has been found that a low-salt diet is an
effective treatment for individuals with Ménière’s disease. It
has been observed that a low-salt diet can cause an increase
in ion transport and plasma aldosterone concentration, which
can absorb endolymph within the endolymphatic sac [22]. It
has been stated that it may be beneficial to exclude foods
with high sodium content from their diets as part of sodium
restriction in these patients
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is an additive found in
frozen foods, canned food, soups, salad dressings, processed
meats and sauces, especially added to flavor Asian dishes.
Reducing MSG intake as part of sodium restriction may also
help prevent Ménière’s disease [23].
3. Caffeine and alcohol consumption
Caffeine is a balanced unbound plant alkaloid found in
the diet as a component of coffee, cocoa, tea, and foods.
Methylxanthine is the most common organic compound found
in caffeine. Decreasing caffeine consumption can cause effects
that can result in symptoms ranging from headaches to mental
disorders). Increased caffeine consumption is believed to play
a role in MD. As is known, caffeine increases vasoconstriction

E. Oğuz, A. Cebeci and C.R. Geçici / Auris Nasus Larynx 48 (2021) 803–808

and decreased blood flow. In this way, impaired autoregulation
of blood flow in ears with endolymphatic hydrops can prevent
adaptation. It is thought that this mechanism will predispose
to migraine and MD [24].
Excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption causes large
fluid changes throughout the physiological fluid compartments, leading to electrochemical instability of inner ear fluids [25]. Caffeine is distributed into body fluid compartments
due to the sympathomimetic and diuretic effects of methylxanthine [26].
In a study comparing caffeine consumption (intake of
coffee, tea, cola-type drinks, energy drinks and chocolatecontaining beverages or foods) between individuals with
Ménière’s disease (group A), patients with dizziness (group
B), and control subjects (group C). It was found that the
group consisting of Menière’s patients consumed higher levels of caffeine compared to the other two study groups [27].
Alcohol consumption is associated with many health problems, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease. Alcohol is considered to be the possible cause of inner
ear abnormalities [28].
The negative effects of alcohol on the cochlea and
labyrinth have been reported by several researchers. Although
scientific evidence of these toxic effects is uncertain, individuals with diseases affecting the inner ear are recommended
to avoid alcohol consumption [28].
To analyze the possible impact of alcoholic beverage consumption on Menière’s disease, two aspects must be considered. Both issues are linked to body fluid balance. First of all,
alcohol consumption includes increased water intake (all alcoholic beverages contain water) and therefore this consumption
should be taken into account when evaluating water intake.
Another issue is the known inhibitory effect of alcohol on hypothalamic vasopressin production [29]. The reduced release
of this neurohormone will increase the diuresis and, as previously stated, both the permeability of water in the inner ear
and endolymph production will normalize by reducing the endolymphatic pressure. Accordingly, it has been reported that
chronic administration of vasopressin causes endolymphatic
hydrops in guinea pigs. In addition, it has been reported that
increasing the level of vasopressin continuously increases the
sodium concentration in the scala media of the cochlea [30].
Based on these findings, some dietary manipulations, such
as ’water intake therapy’, have been proposed in Menière’s
disease.
Alcohol can cause vasoconstriction and a decrease in blood
flow in the inner ear, which can worsen the patient’s symptoms [31]. Although there are few published studies on caffeine and alcohol-related MD, studies include dietary changes
to limit alcohol and caffeine intake [32].
4. Allergy and gluten sensitivity
The relationship between allergy and MD first appeared
in the literature in 1923. Allergy is thought to be one of the
possible extrinsic factor that, when combined with underlying intrinsic factors, may lead to MD. Derebery and Berliner
defined three theories relating allergy to MD that focus on
inflammation within the endolymphatic sac [33]. The sac’s

805

peripheral and fenestrated blood vessels could allow antigen
entry, stimulating mast cell degranulation in the perisaccular connective tissue. A second possible mechanism involves
the production of a circulating immune complex, such as a
food antigen, that accumulates along the endolymphatic sac
fenestrated blood vessels to produce inflammation. This leads
to inflammation and increased permeability as well as fluid
balance disruption. A final theory pertains to a viral antigenallergic interaction. Viruses have been shown to exacerbate
allergic symptoms by enhancing histamine release and can
damage epithelial surfaces as well as trigger T-cell migration
to the endolymphatic sac [34].
Pan et al. study, the frequency of allergies was found to
be higher in patients with Ménière’s compared to the control group [35]. Similarly subjects with a history of MD had
elevated IgE levels compared to control groups (43.3% of
subjects vs. 19.5%) [36]. Savastano et al. found elevated immune complexes, interleukins, and autoantibodies in patients
diagnosed with MD [34].
Food allergies have been associated with MD. In Derebery’s study, wheat (gliadin) was found to be the most common food allergen in MD patients. Gliadin is considered the
major cause of IgE mediated hypersensitivity in people with
wheat allergy [37].
Di Berardino et al. investigated the incidence of gliadin IgE
hypersensitivity in patients affected by MD. Pharmacologically untreated MD patients were recruited and compared with
two control groups. This study compared 58 patients with
MD, 25 healthy controls, and 25 patients with proven grass
pollen rhinoconjunctivitis. There are different possible mechanisms by which an allergic reaction produces MD symptoms.
Skin prick testing has been performed against food allergens
including gliadin. Skin test 8 out of 33 subjects with MD
had a positive response in the early phase and the remaining
5 subjects in the late phase. Gliadin prick test was negative
for both control groups [38,39].
In another study, an increase in the production of antibodies against gluten biomarkers was observed in patients
with MD. This study assessed the reactivity of sera from 28
patients with definite MD and 100 healthy controls against
a repertoire of 51 antigens usually associated with immune
reaction to gluten. MD patients showed an increase of antiwheat IgA, anti-cerebellar peptide IgA and anti-glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD) 65 IgM compared to healthy controls.
In particular, the increase of antiwheat IgA and GAD 65 IgM
has been confirmed in a subgroup of MD patients symptomatically responding to a gluten free diet (GFD). In MD patients, an increase of the antibody production against gluten
biomarkers was observed; in particular, anti- wheat IgA seems
to be associated to clinical response to GFD [38].
Although research on the treatment of allergy due to MD is
limited, patients using immunotherapy and food elimination
treatments for allergy have reported a decrease in the frequency and intensity of attacks, as well as symptoms such as
tinnitus and dizziness, compared to the control group. Questioning the allergy history of patients with Ménière’s and
performing allergy testing will be an appropriate treatment
method.

5. Specially processed cereals
Intake of antisecretory factor (AF)-inducing specially processed cereals (SPC-flakes) has been suggested as complementary therapy for Ménière’s disease. Antisecretory factor
is a 41 kDa protein originally isolated for its ability to inhibit
experimental diarrhea [40]. The detailed mechanism of action
of AF is not known, but AF appears to act as a modulator of
water and ion transport [41]. Antisecretory factor activity can
also be increased by the intake of specific food components
[42,43], for example the intake of SPC-flakes, results in an
increase of AF activity in plasma [42].
Hanner et al. hypothesized that an increased AF activity
could positively affect the course of MD, their work demonstrated that the intake of SPC-flakes not only significantly
reduced vertigo in a half of the patients, but was also associated with an increased level of active AF and positive clinical
outcome [44]. Treatment with SPC appears to be well tolerated by most patients without any complications and, in most
of studies, more than half of the study cohort reported subjective improvement in functional level. AF is thought to play
a role in endolymph homeostasis [45].
By contrast, Ingvardsen and Klokker observed that antisecretory factor-inducing (AF) SPC were not shown to
significantly improve the functional level in patients with MD
[46].
6. Water intake
Regulation of water balance is an important component
of body homeostasis. Aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate osmotic
water transport across plasma membranes [47,48]. So far 13
aquaporin isoforms (AQP0 - AQP12) have been identified.
It was discovered in the inner ear at AQP 1–5, 7 and 9 by
Comacchio et al. [49]. This finding suggests that homeostasis
of inner ear fluids is essential for normal hearing and balance
[48,49]. It has been reported that vasopressin concentration in
the blood of patients with MD increased, vasopressin administration caused endolymphatic hydrops in guinea pigs, and
type-2 vasopressin receptor mRNA was expressed in the rat
inner ear [50].
AQP and K + channels in the inner ear play a role in the
homeostasis of inner ear fluids. Lopes et al. found mutations
in the AQP2, AQP3 and KCNE1 genes in individuals with
MD in their study [51].
Various experimental and clinical evidences suggest a possible role of Arginine-Vasopressin (AVP) in the development
of endolymphatic hydrops. Therefore, it is thought that reducing plasma AVP levels with water intake may be a treatment
method in MD patients [50,52]
The hypothetical explanations for the benefit of water intake therapy for patients with MD is as follows:
1. Adequate water intake during short-term administration
of an osmotic diuretic improves endolymphatic hydrops
and keeps plasma osmolality within the normal range.
2. Low plasma osmolality minimizes the secretion of AVP
from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland.

3. The amount and activity of AVP receptors could be normalized.
4. Water permeability in the inner ear could be normalized
by lower AVP levels in plasma.
5. These actions together would reduce the endolymphatic
pressure and prevent its symptoms [50,52,53].
Naganuma et al. divided individuals with MD into 2 groups
as those treated with conventional treatment and those treated
with the water intake treatment they described. For patients
with MD, water intake therapy shows that water intake is
more effective in correcting and preventing hearing loss compared to conventional therapy. Increasing water consumption
and decreasing plasma Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) level
significantly improved hearing levels in these patients and
decreased attacks were observed. Regulating water may be a
simple and cost- effective treatment method for patients with
MD [53].
One study compared plasma osmolality levels of individuals with MD and normal individuals after 12 h of fasting and
thirst. Although plasma osmolality levels of individuals with
MD were within normal limits, they were found to be higher
than normal individuals [48].

7. Conclusions
Ménière’s disease affect hundreds of thousands of patients
each year around the world. As with many diseases, there is
still no clear cure for this disease. However, significant improvements have been made in dealing with this disease over
the centuries, medical and surgical treatment, dietary modifications and lifestyle changes have been implemented to help
patients cope with symptoms. However, the effect of dietary
modification is highly dependent on patient compliance and
this variable is highly complex. Effects such as food preferences and eating habits of individuals affect the implementation of dietary intervention.
Although diet therapy may not affect everyone the same
way, low sodium diet, restriction of caffeine and alcohol are
often recommended for patients with MD. Patients should be
advised to avoid using salt at the men and limit their use
during cooking, and patients should be counseled to carefully
review the "nutritional information" labels of the products,
not only for sodium content but also for portion size. The
importance of reducing caffeine and alcohol intake in population groups at high risk for MD should be recognized. Caffeine and alcohol intake can cause narrowing of blood vessels
(vasoconstriction) and a decrease in blood flow to the inner
ear. This situation can worsen patients’ symptoms.
The prevalence of allergies in patients with MD is higher
than the general population. When patients with MD and allergies are treated with specific allergy immunotherapy and /
or diet elimination, a significant reduction in the severity of
MD symptoms could be achieved. A restrictive gluten-free
diet could be helpful by eliminating foods containing wheat,
rye, barley, oats and their derivatives especially in Meniere’s
disease patients with gluten allergy. New dietary approach,

E. Oğuz, A. Cebeci and C.R. Geçici / Auris Nasus Larynx 48 (2021) 803–808

such SPC-flakes, are being evaluated, its effectiveness should
be supported by studies.
Because of all these conditions, it is believed that individuals with a complex disease such as MD should include Nutrition and Dietetic Specialists in the treatment and follow-up
process, which is important for both audiologists and nutritionists to work together.
