Background & aims: Remdesivir is a broad spectrum anti-viral drug that has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV2, in vitro and in vivo. In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19),
remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled
studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search
the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID19.
Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5,
2020 using speciﬁc key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-573400 AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and
retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the
clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
Results: Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difﬁcult to quantify, in
the absence of control arm. While the very ﬁrst double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial
conducted in Wuhan, did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant beneﬁt compared to the control, the preliminary result
of another similar multi-country trial has shown a signiﬁcant faster time to recovery but without any
difference in mortality.
Conclusions: Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side
effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials.

1. Introduction
Remdesivir (initially named GS-5734) is an adenosine analogue
that has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several viruses
such as respiratory syncytial virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus (EBOV),
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute
respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) [1e3]. Pharmacologically, remdesivir has been designed to efﬁciently deliver
the monophosphate nucleoside analogue GS-441524 into cells.
Inside the cells, the GS-441524 monophosphate undergoes rapid
conversion to the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate
form GS-443902. Nucleoside triphosphate GS-443902 acts as an
analogue of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the

natural ATP substrate to selectively inhibit viral RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp). The primary mechanism of inhibition is
the incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate GS-443902 into
nascent RNA chains by viral RdRp, causing delayed RNA chain
termination during the process of viral replication [4]. In summary,
remdesivir is a prodrug and inhibits viral RNA polymerases, when
intracellularly metabolized to an ATP analogue.
In vivo efﬁcacy against EBOV in non-human primates led to its
inclusion in clinical studies for the treatment of acute Ebola virus
disease (EVD). It should be noted however, that the efﬁcacy in vitro
or in animal studies does not inevitably predict outcomes in
humans. Interestingly, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
named The Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM, NCT03719586) conducted in 681 patients of acute EBV, remdesivir was found to be less
effective than other monoclonal antibodies, while the mortality
was 53% (signiﬁcantly worse) with remdesivir, compared to 35%
with the most active antibody MAB114. Authors alluded these

differences due to more sicker patients in the remdesivir arm [5].
Another double-blind phase II RCT study named Partnership for
Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia IV (PREVAIL IV, NCT02818582)
conducted in chronic carriers of EVD (n ¼ 38) has been recently
completed, although the full results are still not available in literature [6].
With regards to the coronaviruses, remdesivir has been shown
to inhibit all the animal and human coronaviruses in vitro including
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 [2,7,8]. It has shown antiviral effect and
clinical beneﬁt in animal models of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV
infections [2,9e11]. Interestingly, remdesivir was found to be superior to combined interferon beta plus lopinavireritonavir regime
in the murine models of MERS-CoV infections [9].
Fortunately, remdesivir effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells in vitro study [12]. Early administration of remdesivir
showed a signiﬁcant reduction in viral load in bronchoalveolar
lavage compared to the vehicle and also decreased the pulmonary
inﬁltrates in SARS-CoV-2 infection of rhesus macaque model. Thus,
it demonstrated both antiviral as well as the clinical effects [13].
Moreover, remdesivir was found to be a potent inhibitor of SARSCoV-2 replication in human nasal and bronchial airway epithelial
cells [14]. These outcomes encouraged its use in patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), in the absence of any effective
treatment.
A preliminary report (April 29, 2020) from an interim analysis of
an ongoing double-blind RCT recently suggested that remdesivir
had a 31% faster time to recovery, compared to the placebo
(p < 0.001), in patients with COVID-19 [15]. United State Food Drug
Administration (US FDA) urgently gave the Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA) permission for remdesivir in COVID-19 on May
1, 2020. The current EUA have permitted the use of remdesivir only
to treat adults and children with suspected or laboratory conﬁrmed
COVID-19 and severe disease deﬁned as SpO2  94% on room air,
requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in an in-patient hospital
setting [16]. Historically, this would be the third time USFDA has
given any drug to have a EUA in human, in the absence of approved
indication, pending the results from a large robust trial. Interestingly, earlier on March 30, 2020, FDA also gave EUA to chloroquine
and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, in the
absence of approved indication [17]. In the past, an investigational
neuraminidase inhibitor - peramivir was given EUA by the FDA for
severely ill patients with H1N1 inﬂuenza, during the 2009e2010
outbreak. Although later, RCT failed to show any beneﬁt of peramivir, compared with the placebo, in severely ill hospitalized patients with inﬂuenza. Nonetheless, peramivir has been approved
only for uncomplicated inﬂuenza, since 2014. It should be noted
that the compassionate use of remdesivir in patients with severe
COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation got approval by European Medical Agency on April 3, 2020.
Nevertheless, this prompted us to conduct a systematic search
of remdesivir to understand its pharmacology, safety and efﬁcacy in
patients with COVID-19.
2. Methods
We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and
MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using the several speciﬁc key
words “Remdesivir” or “GS-5734” AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-COV-2”
etc. and retrieved all the articles published in English language that
reported pharmacology and any clinical outcome with the remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. In addition, we also searched the
ClinicalTrial.Org for the ongoing trials with remdesivir in COVID-19.
We compiled all the data chronologically and narrated the past,
present and future of remdesivir in the context of COVID-19.

3. Results
Remdesivir is the most promising repurposed candidate drug
that has shown a consistent inhibitory effect both in vitro and
in vivo against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The overview of all the randomized trials that have been completed or
currently ongoing with the remdesivir in COVID-19 are compiled in
Table 1.
3.1. Efﬁcacy of remdesivir in COVID-19
3.1.1. Efﬁcacy in case studies
The “compassionate use” of remdesivir and purported beneﬁt in
patients with COVID-19 have been reported in some of the case
series, over the last couple of months. The ﬁrst high-proﬁle single
case report from Washington, USA that was published in New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) got attention about remdesivir
[18]. This patient received the ﬁrst dose of remdesivir on hospital
Day 7 (illness Day 11) on a compassionate ground, when progressively found to develop severe pneumonia (clinically and chest Xray-wise), despite receiving parenteral vancomycin (Day 6 only)
and cefepime (Day 6 and 7). Interestingly, the patient recovered
signiﬁcantly on hospital Day 8 (illness Day 12) clinically, with no
requirement of supplemental oxygen (SpO2 improved to 96% from
94% on an ambient air). Unfortunately, no further details of
remdesivir with regards to the dose and duration were made
available. Another case series of 28 severe COVID-19 patient (50% of
total cases eventually died) from Seattle USA, published in NEJM,
Bhatraju et al. [19] also reported that 7 patients had received
remdesivir, however the outcome in these patients on remdesivir
was not reported.
Grein et al. [20] in a data of 53 patients from the 9 countries,
who received a 1 to 10-day course of remdesivir as a compassionate
use, reported clinical improvement in 68% (95% conﬁdence interval
[CI], 40e80%) even with a single dose, at a median follow up of 18
days with only 15% showed worsening; despite inclusion of severe
(57% on mechanical ventilator) and critical (8% on ECMO) patients
with COVID-19. Interestingly, improvement was seen in 100% of
patients with mild (receiving no supplemental or low-ﬂow oxygen)
and 71% patients with moderate (receiving high-ﬂow supplemental
oxygen) COVID-19 at the baseline. Clinical improvement was
deﬁned as live discharge from the hospital, a decrease of at least 2
points from baseline on a modiﬁed ordinal six-point scale or both.
The six-point scale consists of e 1. not hospitalized; 2. hospitalized,
not requiring supplemental oxygen; 3. hospitalized, requiring
supplemental oxygen; 4. hospitalized, requiring nasal high-ﬂow
oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 5.
hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO, or
both; and 6. death. However, several limitations question the validity of the result, as also noted by the authors that include small
size, short duration of follow-up, potential missing data including
the lack of information on eight of the patients initially treated with
remdesivir, lack of randomization and absence of control group.
3.1.2. Efﬁcacy in randomized trials
In the ﬁrst double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial
(DBRCT) conducted with remdesivir versus placebo (n ¼ 236) in
severe COVID-19 patients, Wang et al. [21] found no signiﬁcant
difference in primary outcome of time to clinical improvement
within 28-days either in intention-to-treat analysis (median 21.0
days in remdesivir vs. 23 days in placebo arm; hazard ratio [HR]
1.23; 95% CI, 0.87e1.75, favoring remdesivir) or in the per-protocol
analysis (median 21.0 days in remdesivir vs. 23 days in placebo arm;
HR 1.27, 95% CI; 0.89e1.80, favoring remdesivir). Clinical improvement was deﬁned as a two-point improvement on a 6-point ordinal

scale (as mentioned above in study by Grein et al.). Moreover, no
signiﬁcant difference in 28-day mortality observed between the
remdesivir and placebo (14% death in remdesivir vs. 13% in placebo
group; D 1.1%, 95% CI, 8.1 to 10.3%) group. No difference in viral
load exhibited between the two arms. Neither any difference in
outcome was observed in patient receiving remdesivir early (within
10 days of illness) or late (after 10 days of illness). It should be noted
that this trial was stopped early after recruiting 236 patients due to
the lack of eligible patient in Wuhan, although it was powered for
the inclusion of 453 patients. This early stop may have made this a
statistically underpowered trial to have any conclusive result.
Nevertheless, it was calculated that even if 453 patients would have
been recruited, this trial could not have demonstrated any beneﬁt
[22]. Collectively, this suggest that despite an available result from a
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we still do not know the
beneﬁt or futility of remdesivir, compared to the placebo in patients
with severe COVID-19. Another DBRCT of remdesivir in mild to
moderate COVID-19 patients (n ¼ 308) conducted in China is expected anytime soon [23].
Meanwhile on April 29, 2020, National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID), announced an interim result of a randomized, controlled trial named ACTT (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial) involving 1063 patients (NCT04280705) that started on
Feb 21, 2020 and closed on April 19, 2020 for new enrollments. This
study was conducted at 68 sites (47 in USA and 21 in Europe and
Asia) and sponsored by NIAID, the part of the National Institutes of
Health. Preliminary results indicate that the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared
to 15 days for those who received placebo, thereby suggesting that
patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery
than those who received placebo (p < 0.001). However, the survival
beneﬁt with remdesivir was not statistically signiﬁcant compared
to the control, since remdesivir group had a mortality rate of 8.0%
compared to 11.6% for the placebo group (p ¼ 0.059) [15].
Interestingly, on the same day (April 29, 2020), the Gilead science, manufacturers of remdesivir also announced the top line
results from an open-label, randomized, phase 3, SIMPLE trial
(NCT04292899) that compared the clinical improvement (primary
objective) of 5-days (short-course) versus 10-days (long-course)
treatment duration of remdesivir (n ¼ 397) in hospitalized patients
with severe (evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels,
that did not require mechanical ventilation) COVID-19, in addition
to the standard of care, in 15 countries. Secondary objectives
included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical
response in both treatment groups. Clinical improvement was
deﬁned as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on
a predeﬁned seven-point scale (vide Table 1). The study showed 10days course had similar outcome, compared to 5-days course (Odds
Ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.51e1.12) assessed on Day 14, without any
new safety signals. Interestingly, 5-days course faired similar
although more impressive to 10-days course of remdesivir. The
time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 day vs. 11
day in the 5-days vs. 10-days treatment group, respectively. Patients
discharged from the hospital by Day 14 was 60.0% vs. 52.3%, in 5days vs. 10-days groups, respectively (p ¼ 0.14). Clinical recovery
at Day 14 was 64.5% vs. 58.3% in 5-days vs. 10-days group, respectively. Interestingly, the overall mortality rate in 320 patients on
Day 14 was only 7% in both treatment groups but outside of Italy. An
exploratory analysis of this study suggested a larger beneﬁt, if
remdesivir was initiated early within 10 days of symptoms. Pooled
data from both the arm found that at Day 14, 62% vs. 49% got discharged from the hospital, if remdesivir was started within 10 days
vs. after 10 days of symptoms, respectively [24].

regime of remdesivir (n ¼ 600) in patients with moderate COVID19, compared to the standard of care and is expected at the end
of May 2020 [25]. Other randomized trials that are currently undergoing has been summarized in Table 1 [26e28].
These are the currently available efﬁcacy studies with remdesivir as of now. A comparative pre-clinical, clinical, and cost analysis
of 4 repurposed drug such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine,
chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir have been summarized in
Table 2 [29e54].
3.2. Safety of remdesivir in COVID-19 studies
Adverse event (5%) observed in 4 Phase-1, blinded-studies
(GS-US-399-1812, 1954, 4231, 5505) conducted with remdesivir
(n ¼ 138) in healthy individuals include phlebitis, constipation,
headache, ecchymosis, nausea and pain in the extremities. The
laboratory abnormalities observed during the phase-1 trials
include transient increase in liver enzymes, prothrombin time and
blood sugar in <5% of subjects [4]. While no additional safety information was collected in PALM and PREVAIL IV studies during
EVD, one patient died from hypotension and cardiac arrest at the
time of the loading dose on Day 1 in PALM study (n ¼ 681),
although the death could not be distinguished from underlying
EVD and one of the patients was withdrawn from remdesivir
therapy due to the adverse event in PREVAIL IV trial (n ¼ 38) [4e6].
The common adverse event noted during compassionate use of
remdesivir in patients with COVID-19 by Grein et al. include rash,
diarrhea, hypotension, abnormal liver function and renal impairment. Serious adverse events (acute kidney injury, septic shock,
multi-organ failure) was noted in 23%, while 60% had at least one
adverse event and 8% discontinued due to various side effect of
remdesivir [20]. Adverse events were similar in remdesivir (66%)
and control arm (64%) in study of Wang et al. [21]. Although serious
adverse events reported in 18% vs. 26% in remdesivir vs. control arm
respectively; more patients from the remdesivir group discontinued remdesivir (12%), compared to the control arm (5%)
either because of adverse events or serious adverse events (notably,
5% in remdesivir group had acute respiratory distress syndrome or
respiratory failure). The most common adverse events noted in
SIMPLE trial occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group
were nausea (10.0% vs. 8.6%, 5-days vs. 10-days group, respectively)
and acute respiratory failure (6.0% vs.10.7%, 5-days vs. 10-days
group, respectively). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme elevations
occurred in 7.3% of patients, while 5% in 5-days arm and 10% in 10days arm had to withdraw from remdesivir due to severe adverse
events [24].
3.2.1. Renal safety
Although no evidence of nephrotoxicity was noted in healthy
subjects, some caution is required while using remdesivir. A 150mg dose of the remdesivir solution and lyophilized formulations
of remdesivir contains 9.0 and 4.5 g, of sulfo-butyl-ether b-cyclodextrin-sodium (SBECD), respectively (maximum recommended
daily dose is approximately 250 mg/kg, based on EMA safety review). SBECD is used in the formulation as a solubilizing agent due
to the limited aqueous solubility of remdesivir. Since SBECD is
renally cleared, subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment
may have SBECD exposures. A close look on eGFR is necessary while
administrating remdesivir, especially in patients with known renal
impairment and discontinuation is required if eGFR falls to 50%
from baseline. Although the parent compound remdesivir has only
minor renal excretion, but since urine is found to have 49% of its
metabolite GS-441524, impaired renal impairment may theoretically increase plasma exposure to this metabolite. Nevertheless,
given the beneﬁt-risk ratio in patients with COVID-19, no dose

A.K. Singh et al. / Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews 14 (2020) 641e648

modiﬁcation is currently recommended in patients with mild and
moderate renal impairment, although it is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min). It should
be noted that no speciﬁc studies have been conducted with
remdesivir in patients with renal impairment [4].
3.2.2. Hepatic safety
A substantial proportion of patients with acute EVD who
received remdesivir in PALM trial had moderate to severe liver and
renal dysfunction, however no additional renal or hepatic function
deterioration attributed to remdesivir was noted. Remdesivir is
believed to be rapidly cleaved by hydrolases and thus the effect of
hepatic impairment on remdesivir plasma levels is likely low. Given
the beneﬁt-risk ratio, no dose modiﬁcation is currently recommended in patients with COVID-19, though it is contraindicated in
patients with alanine transferase (ALT) > 5-times upper limit of
normal or severe hepatic dysfunction. There are no speciﬁc studies
conducted with remdesivir in patients with hepatic dysfunction [4].
3.2.3. Pregnancy, Lactation and pediatric population
In non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies, no adverse effect
on embryo-fetal development in pregnant animal or male infertility were observed with remdesivir, however at a systematically
toxic dose an embryonic toxicity was seen. Remdesivir has not been
studied in pregnancy, lactating women and pediatric population.
Interestingly, in PALM study of acute EVD, 3% of pregnant women
and 26% of children received remdesivir, without any notable side
effects [4].
3.2.4. Drug interaction
The potential of induction of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6,
and CYP3A4) following exposure of human hepatocytes to
remdesivir has been seen (the reason for transient increase in liver
enzymes), however, no data available currently for the drug-drug
interaction [4].

viral diseases. From this point of view, treating patients those
already have respiratory failure, may not represent the optimal use
of remdesivir. However, since viral shedding in COVID-19 and
intensive care admission tends to be more protracted, even late
administration could be useful. In this regard, FDA has currently
authorized remdesivir only in severe COVID-19 in both adults and
children. With regards to the outcome of remdesivir in COVID-19,
while one RCT found no beneﬁt, preliminary results from other
RCT have shown some beneﬁt. Therefore, the overall outcome with
remdesivir is perhaps in a stage of clinical equipoise at this point of
time. The safety proﬁle of remdesivir in COVID-19 is incompletely
characterized in COVID-19. While the safety data from the previous
use during acute EVD suggest no speciﬁc alarm, COVID-19 differs
profoundly in its clinical characteristics from EVD. Nevertheless,
hitherto no safety ﬁndings allows remdesivir to be used in COVID19, under a proper pharmacovigilance. Special attention should be
given for disproportionate rise in ALT or decrease in GFR, during the
treatment with remdesivir. The current contraindication of starting
remdesivir with concomitant vasopressors use is primarily based
on this being an indication of end organ failure. In contrast, once a
patient initiates treatment with remdesivir, subsequent use of vasopressors is not a reason for discontinuation of remdesivir.
Moreover, the use of vasopressor at low/medium doses for
inotropic support due to the use of sedation and paralytics while on
the ventilator is allowed.
5. Conclusion
Remdesivir appears to have optimal safety proﬁle although its
efﬁcacy in the treatment of COVID-19 appears to have a mixed
outcome at the moment. Jury is still out and future trials should
further enlighten its cost-effectiveness, in particular when the results of head-to-head trial with other low-cost repurposed drugs is
available.

3.2.5. Formulation and dosing
Remdesivir for injection, 100 mg, is a sterile, preservative-free
lyophilized solid that is to be reconstituted with 19 mL of sterile
water for injection and diluted into 0.9% saline prior to IV administration. Remdesivir for injection, 100 mg, vials should be stored
below 30  C until time of use. Remdesivir injection, 5 mg/mL vials
should be stored at refrigerated temperatures (2  Ce8  C) until
time of use. Following dilution with 0.9% saline, the solution can be
stored for up to 4 h at room temperature (20  Ce25  C) or 24 h at
refrigerated temperatures (2  Ce8  C).
Current dose recommendation of remdesivir in COVID-19 is a
bolus dose of 200 mg IV diluted in normal saline (0.9%) or 5%
dextrose to be given over 60 min on Day 1, followed by 100 mg IV to
be given diluted over 60 min for the next 9 days.
Interestingly, in previous two clinical studies conducted in EVD
such as PALM and PREVAIL IV, the dose used for remdesivir was
200 mg IV over an hour on Day 1 as a loading dose and then 100 mg
IV over 1 h daily for 4 days (in PREVAIL IV) or 9e13 days (in PALM),
as a maintenance dose.
4. Discussion
Remdesivir is an anti-viral agent that has shown a signiﬁcant
inhibitory effect in vitro and in vivo studies against SARS-CoV-2 and
appears to be ahead to other repurposed drug being tried for the
treatment of COVID-19. Table 2 summarize the comparison of results from both pre-clinical and clinical studies of these 4 repurposed candidate drugs. Animal studies clearly hinted that early
administration of remdesivir was more effective like in other acute
